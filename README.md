# Receptive field research

[experiments log](markdown_site/expereiments_log.md)  
  
The research is about understanding of dependence between fully convolutional neural net depth and receptive field size. A lot of experiments were done to find the dependence. See full [experiments log](markdown_site/expereiments_log.md) for details.  
  
#### 1. What is the receptive field?
The concept came from biology:  
[wikipedia: receptive field: In the context of neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field#In_the_context_of_neural_networks).  
The fully convolutional neural net input is image. Output is image or images too.  
Let select a <span style="color:blue">pixel</span> on the output image (blue, see image below). Only limited set of pixel (red) on the input image can influence the selected pixel.
