usage:
python3 main.py SCRIPT
where SCRIPT is script name.
it can be:
experiment_field_size_vs_depth  - to start trains to get field size vs depth data
experiment_field_size_vs_depth_res  - same as previous but with net with residual connections
plot_field_size_vs_depth  - to plot field size vs depth data saved
